		<i>Currently I am fulfilling my military duty as a researcher at the Big Data Research Center(Republic of Korea Army). My military service ends on January 2023.</i>

		I received my Ph.D. degree (ECE, Electrical and Computer Engineering) at the University of Wisconsin Madison in 2021. I was part of <a href="https://biostat.wisc.edu/~compoptics/">Computational Optics Group</a> lead by Professor Andreas Velten. My research interest lies within computational imaging, signal processing, optical engineering and machine learning. I developed computational algorithms and designed optical imaging systems that can "see around corners". I enjoy prototyping imaging systems and bringing them into "real-world". My representive works are published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1461-3" target="_blank">Nature</a> and <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26721-x" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a>.
